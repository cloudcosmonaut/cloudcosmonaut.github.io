# Title
Your title starts with:
To... or How to…
An imperative verb (An imperative verb is a command, such as create or deploy.) 

## Introduction 
The introduction paragraph uses one, two or three sentences. A great introduction:
- Tells the reader exactly what’s in the story
- Explains why it is important
- Tries to pull the reader into reading the story. For example, you can make a promise or ask a question. 

## Conceptual overview
Add one or a few paragraphs to provide the reader with a conceptual overview of what they’re about to do. This is a good place to introduce new and unfamiliar terms. Explain how everything connects together. Bonus points: add a diagram. (I use excalidraw.com.)

## How-to
Use multiple headings to outline the procedure you’re teaching to the reader. Describe no more than 5 to 8 steps under one heading.  

## Caveats
This is where you explain your reader what to watch out for, and if what they just learned is generally applicable or not. 
Summary

A summary is short. Do not introduce new concepts here, or repeat everything you’ve just explained. Instead, do this: 
- Remind the reader what the point was of everything they just learned
- Provide links to next steps
