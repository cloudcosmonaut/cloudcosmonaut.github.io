Or you might have set-up your runners to be detroyed everytime a workflow is triggered. In either case, you can speed up the workflow by using cached versions of tools the workflow need. Node, go, python, etc. These tools are setup with actions/node-setup@v2 or similar step.
The general idea is that you run actions/node-setup@v2 with every version you need and then create a tarball of the runnner.</description></item><item><title>Run unit tests for every Pull Request with GitHub Actions</title><link>https://cloudcosmonaut.io/posts/2021/04/run-unit-tests-for-every-pull-request-with-github-actions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Apr 2021 09:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://cloudcosmonaut.io/posts/2021/04/run-unit-tests-for-every-pull-request-with-github-actions/</guid><description>Testing early and often in your software development cycle is a major part of the DevOps philosophy. With GitHub actions, you can run your test on every Pull Request (PR). Testing as early as possible will detect errors in an early stage so errors can be fixed before releasing.
What are GitHub Actions? You might know GitHub as the open source developers platform. GitHub now contains GitHub Actions. You can compare Github Actions with an Azure Devops Pipeline or an AWS CodePipeline.</description></item></channel></rss>
